## if you do reverse it and post it, dont protect it or obfuscate it. Keep contributing the community!
### instructions (if i breaks cuz of an update)
If you are still getting the 'Is Steam opened?' error and the game was recently updated,
it is likely that the steam_api64.dll of the bypasser is also outdated.
To update it, download the same version of Rust from the 'arabrust' client.
You can download arabrust from here: 'https://arabrust.net/download.html'.
Go to RustClient_Data\Plugins\x86_64 then extract the steam_api64.dll.
And place it in a folder called "custom_steam_api64_dll" wich is,
automatically created on the same directory as the AlkadLoader,
if the bypasser is not outdated, you can ignore this message.
